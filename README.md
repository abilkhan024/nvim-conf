## List to things to watch out for me in the future

- There are some places with hard-coded directory for '~/.config/nvim'
- Haven't done clean install of this configuration, I could mess up plugin orders

### Packer

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
